# Protenix Development Roadmap

## Vision
Enhance Protenix as a fork while maintaining upstream compatibility, focusing on bug fixes, usability improvements, and enterprise deployment capabilities that can be contributed back to ByteDance.

## Fork Development Constraints
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: ByteDance maintains rapid development (35 closed PRs, 0 open). Our roadmap must:
- Submit PRs within 48 hours of completion
- Keep changes small and focused (<500 lines)
- Prioritize upstream-compatible improvements
- Isolate fork-specific features in separate modules
- **NEVER include internal documentation in PRs** (ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, STRATEGY.md, etc.)
- **NEVER include files with SHAD in the filename**

## Current State (v0.5.0)
- ✅ AlphaFold 3 reproduction with competitive accuracy
- ✅ Mini models for faster inference
- ✅ Constraint-guided predictions
- ✅ ColabFold MSA integration
- ⚠️ Installation complexity issues (PRIORITY FIX)
- ⚠️ Performance inconsistencies (PRIORITY FIX)
- ❌ Limited cloud deployment options (FORK FEATURE)
- ❌ No enterprise features (FORK FEATURE)
