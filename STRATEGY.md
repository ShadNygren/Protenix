# Protenix Strategic Development Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic approach for enhancing Protenix as a fork while maintaining compatibility with the upstream ByteDance repository. The strategy focuses on enterprise-grade improvements, cloud deployment, and a two-pass prediction system for drug discovery workflows.

## Core Strategic Principles

### 1. Upstream Alignment (CRITICAL)
Given ByteDance's rapid development pace (35 closed PRs, 0 open):
- **Daily Syncing**: Pull upstream changes daily to minimize conflicts
- **Immediate PR Submission**: Submit PRs within 24-48 hours of completion
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Each PR should be <500 lines when possible
- **Non-Breaking Additions**: All enhancements must be additive
- **Fast Iteration**: Complete features quickly before upstream changes
- **Respect Architecture**: Never modify core design patterns

### 2. Enterprise Focus
- **Production Ready**: Prioritize stability, monitoring, and reliability
- **Cloud Native**: Design for Kubernetes and containerized deployment
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance accuracy with computational costs
- **Security First**: Implement enterprise security requirements from the start

### 3. Scientific Integrity
- **Accuracy Default**: Always default to highest accuracy mode
- **Transparent Trade-offs**: Clearly document any accuracy/speed trade-offs
- **Validation Required**: All optimizations must pass accuracy benchmarks
- **Real Data Only**: Never mix synthetic test data with production code

## Two-Pass Strategy Implementation

### Concept
A two-tier approach optimizing for both high-throughput screening and high-accuracy validation.

### Pass 1: Rapid Screening
**Purpose**: Quickly identify promising candidates from large molecular libraries

**Configuration**:
```yaml
screening_mode:
  model: protenix-mini-esm
  precision: bf16
  diffusion_steps: 2-5
  batch_size: 100
  timeout: 60 seconds
  gpu_memory: 8GB
  
  targets:
    - throughput: 1000 predictions/hour
    - cost: < $0.10/prediction
    - accuracy: 75% correlation with full model
```

**Use Cases**:
- Virtual screening of compound libraries
- Initial binding site identification
- Preliminary drug-target interaction assessment
- Large-scale proteome analysis

### Pass 2: High-Accuracy Validation
**Purpose**: Detailed structural analysis of promising candidates

**Configuration**:
```yaml
validation_mode:
  model: protenix-base
  precision: fp32
  diffusion_steps: 20+
  ensemble_size: 5
  use_constraints: true
  use_templates: true
  batch_size: 1-5
  timeout: 30 minutes
  gpu_memory: 32GB
  
  targets:
    - accuracy: > 90% experimental correlation
    - rmsd: < 2.0 Å
    - confidence: pLDDT > 0.85
```

**Use Cases**:
- Lead compound optimization
- Detailed binding mode analysis
- Publication-quality structure prediction
- Clinical decision support

### Automatic Mode Selection
```python
def select_prediction_mode(request):
    """Automatically choose between screening and validation modes"""
    
    if request.num_structures > 100:
        return "screening"
    
    if request.max_tokens > 1500:
        return "validation"  # Complex structures need full model
    
    if request.urgency == "high" and request.accuracy_required < 0.8:
        return "screening"
    
    if request.constraints or request.high_confidence_required:
        return "validation"
    
    # Default to accuracy
    return "validation"
```

## Development Workflow

### Critical Fork Management Strategy
Given the active upstream (35 closed PRs, 0 open), we must be extremely disciplined:

### Git Strategy
```bash
upstream/main (ByteDance - fetch every day)
    ↓ rebase daily
main (our fork - ALWAYS in sync with upstream)
    ↓
feature/bug-XXX (1-2 day lifespan max)
    ↓ PR to upstream immediately
    
fork/enterprise (our additions - separate module)
```

### Rapid PR Cycle
```python
class PRStrategy:
    MAX_PR_AGE_HOURS = 48  # Submit within 2 days
    MAX_PR_SIZE_LINES = 500  # Keep PRs small
    MAX_FILES_CHANGED = 10  # Focus on specific areas
    
    def manage_pr(self, feature_branch):
        age = hours_since_branch_creation(feature_branch)
        if age > 24:
            logging.warning("Branch aging - submit PR soon!")
        if age > 48:
            logging.error("Branch too old - high conflict risk!")
            return self.split_and_submit_immediately(feature_branch)
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **For Upstream (Priority 1)**:
   - Create feature branch from latest upstream/main
   - Complete work within 24-48 hours
   - Submit PR immediately
   - Monitor for feedback
   - Iterate quickly on requested changes

2. **For Fork-Only Features**:
   - Isolate in fork_features/ directory
   - Use wrapper pattern to avoid core changes
   - Maintain compatibility layer

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Test hierarchy with strict isolation
tests/
├── harness/          # Test infrastructure only
│   ├── fixtures/     # Static, deterministic data
│   └── validators/   # Result verification
├── unit/            # 50% - Component tests
├── integration/     # 30% - Pipeline tests
└── e2e/            # 20% - Full system tests

# Production code NEVER references test harness
# All test data is deterministic and versioned
```

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Optimization Priorities
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce GPU memory requirements
2. **Throughput**: Increase predictions per hour
3. **Latency**: Reduce time to first result
4. **Cost**: Minimize cloud compute costs

### Optimization Techniques
```python
OPTIMIZATIONS = {
    "safe": [
        "batch_processing",
        "feature_caching",
        "connection_pooling",
        "lazy_loading"
    ],
    "moderate": [
        "mixed_precision",  # BF16 for non-critical paths
        "gradient_checkpointing",
        "kernel_fusion",
        "dynamic_batching"
    ],
    "aggressive": [
        "model_quantization",  # Requires validation
        "reduced_diffusion_steps",  # Affects accuracy
        "feature_reduction",  # May impact edge cases
        "approximate_attention"  # Speed vs accuracy trade-off
    ]
}
```

### Benchmark Requirements
Every optimization must:
1. Show performance improvement metrics
2. Pass accuracy regression tests
3. Document any trade-offs
4. Provide rollback mechanism

## Security Strategy

### Security Layers
1. **Input Validation**
   - File format verification
   - Size limits
   - Malicious pattern detection

2. **Process Isolation**
   - Container sandboxing
   - Resource limits
   - Network segmentation

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption in transit (TLS)
   - Encryption at rest
   - Key management (Vault/KMS)

4. **Access Control**
   - API key authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Usage quotas

### Compliance Considerations
- HIPAA for healthcare applications
- GDPR for EU users
- SOC2 for enterprise customers
- FDA validation pathway documentation

## Monitoring & Operations

### Key Metrics
```python
METRICS = {
    "business": [
        "predictions_per_day",
        "unique_users",
        "success_rate",
        "customer_satisfaction"
    ],
    "technical": [
        "gpu_utilization",
        "memory_usage",
        "cache_hit_rate",
        "error_rate"
    ],
    "scientific": [
        "average_plddt",
        "rmsd_distribution",
        "constraint_satisfaction",
        "ensemble_consistency"
    ]
}
```

### Alerting Strategy
- **Critical**: System down, data loss risk
- **High**: Accuracy degradation, high error rate
- **Medium**: Performance degradation, high latency
- **Low**: Capacity warnings, maintenance needed

## Cost Management

### Cost Optimization Targets
```yaml
targets:
  screening_mode:
    cost_per_prediction: < $0.10
    gpu_hours_per_1000: < 2
    
  validation_mode:
    cost_per_prediction: < $5.00
    gpu_hours_per_prediction: < 0.5
    
  infrastructure:
    monthly_fixed_costs: < $5000
    storage_costs: < $1000/TB
```

### Cost Reduction Strategies
1. **Spot Instances**: For batch processing
2. **Reserved Capacity**: For baseline load
3. **Auto-scaling**: Match capacity to demand
4. **Regional Distribution**: Use cheaper regions
5. **Caching**: Reduce redundant computation

## Community Engagement
