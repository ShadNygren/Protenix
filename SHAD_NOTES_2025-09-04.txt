● I've successfully created all four strategic documentation files for the Protenix project:

  📄 ARCHITECTURE.md

  Describes the system's technical architecture including:
  - Multi-tier pipeline from input to output
  - Model variants (Base, Mini, Mini-ESM) with clear performance/accuracy trade-offs
  - Two-pass prediction strategy for drug discovery
  - Container-based deployment architecture
  - Memory and scalability considerations

  📄 DESIGN.md

  Details the design patterns and principles with special emphasis on:
  - Critical test data isolation - All synthetic/mock data strictly confined to test harnesses
  - Real data as default for all business logic
  - Two-pass predictor implementation
  - Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
  - Test pyramid: 50% unit, 30% integration, 20% E2E tests

  📄 ROADMAP.md

  Provides a phased development plan:
  - Phase 1 (Q1 2025): Fix critical bugs and usability issues
  - Phase 2 (Q2 2025): Add enterprise features and two-pass system
  - Phase 3 (Q3 2025): Performance optimization
  - Phase 4 (Q4 2025): Advanced drug discovery features
  - Phase 5 (2026): Community ecosystem building

  📄 STRATEGY.md

  Outlines the strategic approach focusing on:
  - Two-pass system: Fast screening (Mini model) → High-accuracy validation (Base model)
  - Clear accuracy vs speed trade-offs with accuracy as default
  - Enterprise-grade improvements while maintaining upstream compatibility
  - Contribution strategy for working with ByteDance's upstream
  - Cost optimization targets (<$0.10 for screening, <$5 for validation)

  The documentation emphasizes your key requirements:
  - Enterprise-grade deployment with security and monitoring
  - Two-pass approach for efficient drug discovery workflows
  - Real data only in production code with test data strictly isolated
  - Accuracy first with explicit opt-in for speed optimizations
  - Cloud-native Docker/Kubernetes deployment
  - Fork strategy focusing on bugs and usability issues that can be contributed back

  These documents provide a comprehensive guide for developing your fork while maintaining alignment with the upstream project and focusing on practical improvements for the drug
  discovery community.

        5 +  ## Fork Development Context
        6 +  
        7 +  **CRITICAL**: This is a FORK of ByteDance's actively maintained Protenix project. ByteDance processes PRs rapidly (35 closed, 0 open), requiring special development
          +  practices:
        8 +  
        9 +  ### Fork Constraints
       10 +  1. **Daily Upstream Sync**: Always fetch and rebase from upstream/main
       11 +  2. **48-Hour PR Rule**: Submit PRs within 48 hours to avoid conflicts
       12 +  3. **Small Changes**: Keep PRs under 500 lines, 10 files maximum
       13 +  4. **Upstream First**: Prioritize changes that can be contributed back
       14 +  5. **Isolation**: Keep fork-specific features in `fork_features/` directory
       15 +  
       16 +  ### Our Fork Focus
       17 +  - **Priority 1**: Fix bugs affecting community (#182, #185, #176, #186)
       18 +  - **Priority 2**: Improve usability and documentation
       19 +  - **Priority 3**: Add enterprise features (isolated in fork_features/)
       20 +  - **Priority 4**: Two-pass prediction system for drug discovery
       21 +

● I've successfully created and updated all the documentation files to properly reflect the fork development strategy and testing requirements. Here's a summary of what was done:

  📄 TESTING.md (NEW)

  Created comprehensive testing documentation that:
  - Emphasizes strict separation of test data from production code
  - Defines fork-specific test structure in tests_fork/ directory
  - Specifies 50% unit, 30% integration, 20% E2E test distribution
  - Includes deterministic test fixtures only (no random data)
  - Provides fork compatibility testing strategies
  - Details the 48-hour PR submission requirement

  📄 DESIGN.md (UPDATED)

  - Removed detailed testing sections (moved to TESTING.md)
  - Added comprehensive fork development strategy
  - Included branch management for rapid PR cycles
  - Defined change categories (upstream vs fork-specific)
  - Added fork-aware container structure

  📄 ARCHITECTURE.md (UPDATED)

  - Added fork architecture considerations section
  - Defined compatibility layer for upstream isolation
  - Specified modular extension points for fork features
  - Added fork_features/ directory structure
  - Listed fork-safe optimizations

  📄 STRATEGY.md (UPDATED)

  - Emphasized critical upstream alignment with daily syncing
  - Added rapid PR cycle requirements (48-hour maximum)
  - Defined PR size limits (<500 lines, <10 files)
  - Updated git workflow for active upstream management

  📄 ROADMAP.md (UPDATED)

  - Restructured to align with fork constraints
  - Organized by weekly sprints with immediate PR submissions
  - Separated upstream contributions from fork-only features
  - Added fork development priority matrix
  - Specified PR guidelines and timelines

  📄 CLAUDE.md (UPDATED)

  - Added critical fork development context at the top
  - Included daily sync workflow commands
  - Specified 48-hour PR rule and size constraints
  - Added fork-specific development workflow
  - Clarified testing requirements

  Key Takeaways for Fork Management:

  1. Rapid PR Cycle: With ByteDance's fast PR processing (35 closed, 0 open), we must submit PRs within 48 hours to avoid conflicts
  2. Small, Focused Changes: Each PR should be <500 lines and <10 files to increase acceptance likelihood
  3. Daily Syncing: Must fetch and rebase from upstream daily to stay current
  4. Test Isolation: All test data strictly confined to tests_fork/harness/ with deterministic fixtures only
  5. Fork Features: Enterprise features isolated in fork_features/ directory to avoid merge conflicts
  6. Two-Pass System: Designed as an enhancement that can potentially be contributed upstream after discussion

  This documentation framework ensures we can effectively contribute bug fixes and improvements back to ByteDance while maintaining our enterprise enhancements in a sustainable
  way.
